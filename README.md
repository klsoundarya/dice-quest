### Five Planes of User Experience

The five planes are like layers that designers think about when making things for people to use. It starts with big ideas and end with the actual look and feel of what users interact with.

#### The Strategy Plane

The strategy reason for my website is to create a virtual platform for gamers that showcases the excitement and challenge of the dice quest-dice roll game, allowing users to engage with and enjoy this classic game online.

#### The Scope Plane

Based on the Strategy Plane, the scope of my website includes implementing the rules of "Dice Quest," allowing players to interactively roll dice and track scores over multiple rounds, providing buttons for starting the game, changing player names, and toggling sound effects, with future features including a dark theme toggle and a comprehensive view of game rules.

#### The Structure Plane

After the scope plane was decided, it's time to create a structure for my "Dice Quest" virtual game website. The structure includes the layout of the homepage, game interface, rules section, and user interactions such as rolling dice, and controlling game settings. This ensures a clear, logical flow and user-friendly experience for the players.

| 1  | ![Bug 1](read-me/bugs/player-name.PNG) | Player/User name is not loading, I fixed it by targeting the element and using the innerHtml to add in the player name. | Fixed the bug  |

This ensures that the scoreboard names are updated in real-time, reflecting the latest changes made by the user. 	| Fixed the bug. 	|
| 6 	| ![Bug 6](read-me/bugs/null.PNG)        	| When a user clicks the "Cancel" button in the prompt without entering a new name, the player1Score and player2Score variables are updated to null. This causes the scoreboard to display null instead of the original names. To fix this issue, I used conditional operators to check if the user has entered a new name before updating the scoreboard.                                     	| Fixed the bug.	|
