# Shut the Box

"Shut the Box" is a classic dice game traditionally played on a wooden board with tiles numbered 1 to 9 or 1 to 12. Players roll dice and flip down tiles that match the numbers they roll. The aim is to flip down all the tiles, or "shut the box," by making strategic decisions based on the dice rolls. It's a game of both luck and strategy that can be enjoyed alone or with others. Now, users/players can enjoy this timeless game virtually through my gaming webpage.

### Five Planes of User Experience

The five planes are like layers that designers think about when making things for people to use. It starts with big ideas and end with the actual look and feel of what users interact with.

#### The Strategy Plane

The strategy reason for my website is to create a virtual platform for gamers that showcases the excitement and challenge of the Shut the Box game, allowing users to engage with and enjoy this classic game online.

#### The Scope Plane

Based on the Strategy Plane, the scope of my website includes implementing the rules of "Shut the Box," allowing players to interactively turn down number flaps from 1 to 9 based on dice rolls, providing buttons for starting the game, toggling dark theme(in the future feature), adjusting volume, and viewing game rules.

#### The Structure Plane

After the scope plane was decided, it's time to create a structure for my "Shut the Box" virtual game website. The structure includes the layout of the homepage, game interface, rules section, and user interactions such as rolling dice, selecting number flaps, and controlling game settings. This ensures a clear, logical flow and user-friendly experience for the players.
