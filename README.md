#### The Strategy Plane

The strategy reason for my website is to create a virtual platform for gamers that showcases the excitement and challenge of the dice quest-dice roll game, allowing users to engage with and enjoy this classic game online.

#### The Scope Plane

Based on the Strategy Plane, the scope of my website includes implementing the rules of "Dice Quest," allowing players to interactively roll dice and track scores over multiple rounds, providing buttons for starting the game, changing player names, and toggling sound effects, with future features including a dark theme toggle and a comprehensive view of game rules.

#### The Structure Plane

After the scope plane was decided, it's time to create a structure for my "Dice Quest" virtual game website. The structure includes the layout of the homepage, game interface, rules section, and user interactions such as rolling dice, and controlling game settings. This ensures a clear, logical flow and user-friendly experience for the players.
